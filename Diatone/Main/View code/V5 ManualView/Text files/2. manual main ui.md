THE KEYBOARD AND THE OPTION VIEW

When you first open the Arithmophone Diatone app, you will see the keyboard, divided into a right and a left section divided by a small vertical bar. The left and right sections combine to form one keyboard together: to play a scale, alternate between playing the left and right keys as you move up or down the keyboard. The keyboard responds to both initial touch and aftertouch: try hitting the keys on different places and moving your finger around while you hold down a key to hear the effect this has on the sound.

Touching the 'UNFOLD' text in the central bar will unfold the option view, which has three different pages for adjusting the scale, sound and keyboard setup. When you're done adjusting the settings, you can always touch the 'FOLD' button at the top of the screen to close the option view, maximizing the playable area of the keys.

The bottom of the option view always shows the note display, that lets you know which notes are currently mapped to the keyboard by corresponding colours (this changes as you switch do different scales and/or keys). 

 
 THE SCALE VIEW
 
 The scale view lets you switch between different scales, keys and and tunings. At the top of the page (just below the main page selector) is the Scale Display. This swhos an image that represents the selected scale and tuning. What these images mean exactly is explained at the end of section III of this guide, but mainly, they serve as a quick visual indication of where you are currently at. Beneath the Scale Display are 5 options for changing the the notes of the keyboard:
 
 1) Tuning. Here you can switch between just intonation and equal temperament tuning. Just intonation uses rational harmonic intervals, where the notes sound perfectly in tune with each other, while equal temperament is the standard tuning of Western musical instruments like guitars and pianos. Both of these tuning modes have their own distinct character. The differences are fairly subtle but in general, with just intonation some note combinations sound perfect together while other combinations sound quite out of tune, whereas in equal temperament, no note combinations are perfect, but all combinations are pretty good. If you'd like to learn more about this, you can find all the necessary details in section III of this guide.
