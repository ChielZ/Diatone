    "A whole step / half step note system divides the octave in to 12 steps, so you can think of the process of making a diatonic scale as picking 7 out of 12 notes. If you have ever played a piano-style keyboard, you may have noticed that there are 7 white keys and 5 black keys for each octave. This is no coincidence. The piano keyboard is essentially a diatonic design, with its 'natural' notes being the white keys. The black keys 'fill the gaps' between the notes that are a whole tone apart, and because there are only five such gaps, there are only five black keys. Some of the white keys (B and C, E and F) are just a semitone apart, and these don't have a black key in between them." : {

In principle this goes on forever, but the relative loudness of the overtones decreases as their frequency increases, so in practice the first few overtones are much more prominent than the higher ones. If we listen to the harmonics in isolation, we can hear that they correspond to different notes. The second harmonic of the A string produces another A, an octave higher, the third harmonic produces an E, the fourth harmonic is an A again, 2 octaves higher this time, and the fifth harmonic produces a C#." : {

    "An Arithmophone is a thing that turns numbers into sounds, or math into music. Its name is derived from the ancient Greek words ἀριθμός (arithmos; number) and φωνή (phone; sound). The device you're holding in your hands right now is itself an Arithmophone, in the sense that it routinely turns long strings of binary numbers into sounds. But this app is a bit more 'arithmophonic' still, because it uses pure and simple harmonic ratios like 3/2 and 5/4 to produce musical notes." : {

    },
    "An important characteristic of just intonation is that there are multiple options for each note (except for the root, which is always 1:1). For example, for root D, there is a C at 9:5 (because 3:1 on D is A, 3:1 on A is E, 1:5 on E is C and 3/1 x 3/1 x 1/5 = 9/5), but there is also a C at 1:9 (because 1:3 on D is G, 1:3 on G is C and 1/3 x 1/3 is 1/9). These notes share the same name, but they don't have the same frequency (because 9/5 is not equal to 1/9, not even when we change the latter to 16/9 so they fall in the same octave). The distance is subtle enough that tempered tunings can 'sweep it under the rug' and represent both ratios with just a single note, but it is definitely audible, and becomes particularly apparent when multiple notes are played simultaneously in chords. And these are just two of the options for the C note on D: there are other, more 'exotic' candidates for the C note as well, most notably the 'pure harmonic seventh' or 7/1 ratio, and there are multiple options for all other notes as well. With just intonation, there are essentially infinitely many different notes, which has both its advantages and its disadvantages." : {

    "As classical music evolved in Western Europe, keyboard instruments like organs and harpsichords became more prominent, and modulation between different keys became an important part of the musical style. This motivated instrument makers and music theorists to explore alternatives to just intonation tuning, and this finally led to the introduction of 12 tone equal temperament, which has since become the standard tuning system for Western musical instruments, from guitars and pianos to saxophones and synthesizers." : {

    },
    "As we have seen in the section on just intonation, we can find all the notes of Western diatonic music just by combining the third and fifth harmonic, so all of these are available in 12 tone equal temperament. All of the notes are now slightly out of tune with respect to each other, but none of them terribly much so. This means we can now play in any key we like without having to worry about retuning our instruments." : {

    "Because the keyboard of the Arithmophone Diatone has only 7 notes per octave, it is much easier to play scales and melodies on it than on a 'chromatic' instrument like a piano or a guitar: just select the scale you need and there are no 'wrong notes' to worry about anymore. But because it is also very quick and easy to change scales and keys, the Diatone still retains much of the flexibility of standard chromatic instruments, and there is lots of depth to explore here for more advanced users." : {

    "Below the preset selection buttons there are three sliders that let you adjust the sound to your liking. These are automatically reset to their default (centered) positions when a new preset is selected. The 'Volume' slider simply makes the sound softer or louder.

If you are playing by yourself then it may be worth experimenting a bit to see if you can hear the different feeling each tuning system imparts on your playing. Don't be discouraged if you don't immediately hear the difference: it's subtle and more prominent on some note combinations than on other, but it's definitely there." : {

    "Each of the overtones of a note stands in a certain ratio to its root frequency, and each of those ratios corresponds to a certain note. We can use this fact to tune the other strings of the violin (or the other notes on any instrument in general) in relation to one specific root frequency, and this is in fact precisely what just intonation means. When we sound the second harmonic of the A string, which produces the note E, and then tune our E string so that it resonates perfectly with the harmonic, we are using just intonation, plain and simple." : {

    "Each of the preset sounds can be changed by adjusting the 'volume', 'tone' and 'ambience' sliders, and the keyboard's response can be customised further on the 'setup' page. Diatone's sound engine uses a combination of Frequency Modulation and substractive synthesis. It is inspired by some classic digital synthesizers and keyboards from the 1980s, but it also adds a few more modern twists like binaural stereo imaging and effects." : {

    },
    "Finally, the bend control lets you adjust how much the pitch of the notes change as you move your fingers from left to right (or from right to left of course) while holding down keys. A setting of 0 means no pitch bend, this is the easiest to play and ensures that your notes are always perfectly in tune. Settings between 100 and 250 will allow you to bend the notes in a reasonably controlled manner, giving you access to all the 'notes in between the notes'. This will let you play guitar solo-like note bends and - with some practice and depending on the sound you've selected - you can even play full chromatic scales on the keyboard. It does require more careful playing though, as you'll need to avoid unintentional finger motion. Higher settings of 500 to 750 will allow for very wide pitch slides, great for theremin-like sounds and special effects, but difficult to control. Some of the presets have this pitch bending 'built in' and these also feature sounds that are particularly suited for it. Tip: when trying this out, make sure the keys are displayed with enough size to give you maximum control over the effect - so try folding the option view to increase the key size, or if you're using an iPad, switch to landscape orientation." : {

    "It should be noted that there are also some very rich musical traditions that can be represented neither by 12 tone equal temperament nor by '3-5 grid' harmonic ratios. A great example of this is the Arabic Maqam system.

Unfortunately, this takes it outside of the current scope of this app, but to be aware of this is a great reminder of the infinite subtleties and complexities of music at least." : {

If you lightly touch the string at exactly half the length of the string (on a fretted instrument like a guitar, this is just over the 12th fret), you will mute the root frequency and accentuate the second harmonic. If you place your finger at one third of the length (or over the 7th fret), you will hear the third harmonic accentuated, et cetera.

This can only be resolved by retuning the entire instrument - but in that case it will no longer be in tune in the key of C." : {

To avoid confusion, we should pay careful attention to the distinction between scale position and harmonic position. For example, in the C major scale, E is the third note and for this reason, the interval from C to E is usually called the (major) third, but E is the fifth harmonic of C. In contrast, G is the fifth note of the scale and usually called the (perfect) fifth, even though G is the third harmonic of C." : {

The differences are fairly subtle but in general, with just intonation some note combinations sound perfect together while other combinations sound quite out of tune, whereas in equal temperament, no note combinations are perfect, but all combinations are quite acceptable.

But we can go the other way as well: 1:3 is D (because 3:1 on D is A) and 1:5 is F (because 5:1 on F is A).

Playing all the white keys on a piano creates a scale with 7 different letters, which works perfectly, but if you were to start on the note A and then play every next note up until you reached the seventh, you would get a sequence like this: A, Bb, B, C, C#, D, Eb. While this is a 7 note scale in some sense, it isn't a very musically useful scale, and this is because it doesn't have 'one of each note'. Instead, there are two versions of 'B' and two version of 'C', while the letters F and G are missing from the scale altogether. On the other hand, as long as you make sure that your scale includes a note for each of the 7 letters, you're very likely to produce a musical sounding scale, even if the sequence is something complicated like A, Bb, C#, D, Eb, F#, G." : {

    "When you play an open A string on a violin, the string vibrates at a rate of 440 times per second (assuming the violin is in standard tuning). This rate is called the frequency, and is usually expressed in Hertz (Hz). So the pitch of the tuned A string is 440 Hz. But the sound you hear is not just a single frequency, because the string also vibrates at multiples of its root frequency, like 880 Hz (2x440), 1320 Hz (3x440), and so on. These multiples of the root frequency are called overtones or harmonics. Together they combine with the root frequency to produce a complex sound that gives the instrument its own particular tone colour or timbre." : {

    "With 12 tone equal temperament, what we loose in tuning accuracy, we gain in flexibility. Whether or not this is a good tradeoff really depends on the musical context. Listen to a piano piece by a 19th century composer like Debussy or Brahms and you will hear the full power of 12 tone equal temperament: that kind of harmonic motion and musical flexibility is hardly possible in a just intonation context. But listen to a West-African Kora piece by one of the great players of the instrument like Toumani Diabaté or Ballaké Sissoko and you can hear the sweet harmonic purity of just intonation, that is impossible to achieve on an instrument tuned to equal temperament." : {
