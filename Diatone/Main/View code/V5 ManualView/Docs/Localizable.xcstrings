    "An Arithmophone is a thing that turns numbers into sounds, or math into music. Its name is derived from the ancient Greek words ἀριθμός (arithmos; number) and φωνή (phone; sound). The device you're holding in your hands right now is itself an Arithmophone, in the sense that it routinely turns long strings of binary numbers into sounds. But this app is a bit more 'arithmophonic' still, because it uses pure and simple harmonic ratios like 3/2 and 5/4 to produce musical notes." : {

    },
    "Because the keyboard of the Arithmophone Diatone has only 7 notes per octave, it is much easier to play scales and melodies on it than on a 'chromatic' instrument like a piano or a guitar: just select the scale you need and there are no 'wrong notes' to worry about anymore. But because it is also very quick and easy to change scales and keys, the Diatone still retains much of the flexibility of standard chromatic instruments, and there is lots of depth to explore here for more advanced users." : {

    },
    "Below the preset selection buttons there are three sliders that let you adjust the sound to your liking. These are automatically reset to their default (centered) positions when a new preset is selected. The 'Volume' slider simply makes the sound softer or louder. Tip: set the volume to the desired level with the main volume controls of your device while the Diatone's volume slider is in its center position, then use the slider for quick 'on the fly' adjustments or expressive control." : {

If you rest your device on your lap or some other suitable surface, you can also use your other fingers to play chords and arpeggios as well. To play the notes in scale order, start with the lowest key on the left, then play the lowest key on the right, then the second key on the left, and so on." : {

    },
    "Diatone has its own built-in sound engine and there are 49 preset sounds to choose from. The sounds respond to initial touch (where on the key you first place your finger) and aftertouch (how you move your finger on the key while holding it down). Different preset sounds respond to your touch in different ways: on some sounds, moving your finger may change the brightness of the tone, on others it may change the pitch, allowing you to 'bend' the notes, and so on." : {

    "Finally, the bend control lets you adjust how much the pitch of the notes change as you move your fingers from left to right (or from right to left of course) while holding down keys. A setting of 0 means no pitch bend, this is the easiest to play and ensures that your notes are always perfectly in tune. Settings between 100 and 250 will allow you to bend the notes in a reasonably controlled manner, giving you access to all the 'notes in between the notes'. This will let you play guitar solo-like note bends and - with some practice and depending on the sound you've selected - you can even play full chromatic scales on the keyboard. It does require more careful playing though, as you'll need to avoid unintentional finger motion. Higher settings of 500 to 750 will allow for very wide pitch slides, great for theremin-like sounds and special effects, but difficult to control. Some of the presets have this pitch bending 'built in' and these also feature sounds that are particularly suited for it. Tip: when trying this out, make sure the keys are displayed with enough size to give you maximum control over the effect - so try folding the option view to increase the key size, or if you're using an iPad, switch to landscape orientation." : {

    "Tuning: here you can switch between just intonation and equal temperament tuning. Just intonation uses rational harmonic intervals, where the notes sound perfectly in tune with each other, while equal temperament is the standard tuning of Western musical instruments like guitars and pianos. Both of these tuning modes have their own distinct character. The differences are fairly subtle but in general, with just intonation some note combinations sound perfect together while other combinations sound quite out of tune, whereas in equal temperament, no note combinations are perfect, but all combinations are quite acceptable. If you'd like to learn more about this, please read the background information in section III of this guide, but you don't need to worry about this if you don't want to. In general, you can simply leave this on 'just' when you're playing by yourself, or switch to 'equal' when you're playing together with other instruments." : {
