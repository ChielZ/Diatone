    "A whole step / half step note system divides the octave in to 12 steps, so you can think of the process of making a diatonic scale as picking 7 out of 12 notes. If you have ever played a piano-style keyboard, you may have noticed that there are 7 white keys and 5 black keys for each octave. This is no coincidence. The piano keyboard is essentially a diatonic design, with its 'natural' notes being the white keys. The black keys 'fill the gaps' between the notes that are a whole tone apart, and because there are only five such gaps, there are only five black keys. Some of the white keys (B and C, E and F) are just a semitone apart, and these don't have a black key in between them." : {

    "An Arithmophone is a thing that turns numbers into sounds, or math into music. Its name is derived from the ancient Greek words ἀριθμός (arithmos; number) and φωνή (phone; sound). The device you're holding in your hands right now is itself an Arithmophone, in the sense that it routinely turns long strings of binary numbers into sounds.

    "Because the keyboard of the Arithmophone Diatone has only 7 notes per octave, it is much easier to play scales and melodies on it than on a 'chromatic' instrument like a piano or a guitar: just select the scale you need and there are no 'wrong notes' to worry about anymore. But because it is also very quick and easy to change scales and keys, the Diatone still retains much of the flexibility of standard chromatic instruments, and there is lots of depth to explore here for more advanced users." : {

    "Finally, the bend control lets you adjust how much the pitch of the notes change as you move your fingers from left to right (or from right to left of course) while holding down keys. A setting of 0 means no pitch bend, this is the easiest to play and ensures that your notes are always perfectly in tune. Settings between 100 and 250 will allow you to bend the notes in a reasonably controlled manner, giving you access to all the 'notes in between the notes'. This will let you play guitar solo-like note bends and - with some practice and depending on the sound you've selected - you can even play full chromatic scales on the keyboard. It does require more careful playing though, as you'll need to avoid unintentional finger motion. Higher settings of 500 to 750 will allow for very wide pitch slides, great for theremin-like sounds and special effects, but difficult to control. Some of the presets have this pitch bending 'built in' and these also feature sounds that are particularly suited for it. Tip: when trying this out, make sure the keys are displayed with enough size to give you maximum control over the effect - so try folding the option view to increase the key size, or if you're using an iPad, switch to landscape orientation." : {

This contrasts it with, for example, pentatonic scales (which have only 5 notes per octave) and with the chromatic scale (which contains all of the available notes in 12 tone equal temperament)." : {

    },
    "Just intonation has one significant limitation: because the intervals are defined by their relationship to a root note, some note combinations work perfectly while others don't. If you change the root note or modulate to a different key, the ratios change and some intervals that were pure may no longer be. This is why just intonation works beautifully for music that stays centered around one key, but can be challenging for music that moves between different keys frequently." : {

    },
    "Just intonation is a a way of tuning that is based on the natural harmonics of musical notes. This is most easily explained by using a stringed instrument like a violin as an example, but it applies just as much to any other musical instrument, from saxophones to synthesizers, and also to the human voice." : {

A major third in the key of C sounds exactly the same size as a major third in the key of F# or any other key.

This flexibility is why equal temperament became the standard tuning for Western music." : {

To keep all the notes within a single octave, you multiply or divide by 2 as needed. This creates a lattice of musical notes, all related to each other through pure harmonic ratios." : {

You don't have 12 notes at your fingertips at all times, but you choose which notes you want to map to the keyboard by selecting a key and scale instead. This is more similar to instruments like the harp or the harmonica, that are tuned to a specific scale - except that retuning to a different scale or key is instant and effortless on the Diatone." : {

The familiar 'do re mi fa sol la ti do' is such a scale, but there are many others as well. The Arithmophone Diatone has 12 different scales to choose from, and each of these can be played in any musical key and in two different tuning modes: just intonation (rational harmonic intervals, where the notes sound perfectly in tune with each other) or equal temperament (standard Western tuning, suitable for playing along with guitars, pianos et cetera)." : {

    },
    "The trade-off is that equal temperament intervals are based on irrational numbers (roots and powers of 2) rather than simple ratios. This means that most intervals are slightly 'out of tune' compared to their just intonation equivalents. A major third in equal temperament is about 14 cents (14 hundredths of a semitone) sharper than the pure 5/4 ratio, and a perfect fifth is about 2 cents flatter than the pure 3/2 ratio. These differences are small enough that the intervals still sound good, but you can hear a subtle 'beating' or wavering quality that isn't present in pure just intonation intervals." : {

Just intonation uses rational harmonic intervals, where the notes sound perfectly in tune with each other, while equal temperament is the standard tuning of Western musical instruments like guitars and pianos. Both of these tuning modes have their own distinct character. The differences are fairly subtle but in general, with just intonation some note combinations sound perfect together while other combinations sound quite out of tune, whereas in equal temperament, no note combinations are perfect, but all combinations are quite acceptable. If you'd like to learn more about this, please read the background information in section III of this guide, but you don't need to worry about this if you don't want to.

Playing all the white keys on a piano creates a scale with 7 different letters, which works perfectly, but if you were to start on the note A and then play every next note up until you reached the seventh, you would get a sequence like this: A, Bb, B, C, C#, D, Eb. While this is a 7 note scale in some sense, it isn't a very musically useful scale, and this is because it doesn't have 'one of each note'. Instead, there are two versions of 'B' and two version of 'C', while the letters F and G are missing from the scale altogether. On the other hand, as long as you make sure that your scale includes a note for each of the 7 letters, you're very likely to produce a musical sounding scale, even if the sequence is something complicated like A, Bb, C#, D, Eb, F#, G." : {
