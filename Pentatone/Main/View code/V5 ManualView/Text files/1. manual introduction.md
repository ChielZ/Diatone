 INTRODUCTION
 
 WHAT IS AN ARITHMOPHONE?
 
 An Arithmophone is a thing that turns numbers into sounds, or math into music. Its name is derived from the ancient Greek words ἀριθμός (arithmos; number) and φωνή (phone; sound). The device you're holding in your hands right now is itself an Arithmophone, in the sense that it routinely turns long strings of binary numbers into sounds. But this app is even more 'arithmophonic' than that, because it uses pure and simple harmonic ratios like 3/2 and 5/4 to produce musical notes. You can use this app as a musical instrument, a source of melodic and harmonic inspiration or a tool for exploring the deep connection between music and numbers.

 
 WHAT IS PENTATONE?
 
 Pentatone is a music keyboard app that is designed from the ground up for the form factor of handheld touchscreen devices. It turns your phone or tablet into an instrument with the right ergonomics for playing music. Rather than emulating a piano or a guitar fretboard (which are both very well designed interfaces, but with a very different form factor), the Pentatone takes inspiration from traditional African instruments like the Kora, on which melodies are played by alternating between the left and right hand, and the Mbira (also known as Kalimba or Karimba)
