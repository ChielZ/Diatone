 PAGE 1 - OSCILLATORS (OscillatorView)
 
 1) Oscillator Waveform
 Here you can select the waveform of the FM carrier and modulator oscillators (they both always share the same waveform). Sine waves are the standard for FM synthesis and produce predictable and familiar sounding results. Triangle waves produce a subtly different tonal palette. Square waves will yield wild and unpredictable results.
 
 2) Carrier multiplier
 This sets the carrier oscillator frequency to a multiple of the base frequency of the note being played. Changing this will affect the pitch of the sound directly and set it to the corresponding harmonic of the base note.
 
 3) Modulator multiplier coarse
 This sets the modulator oscillator frequency to a multiple of the base frequency of the note being played. Changing this will mainly affect the timbre of the sound, because the modulator oscillator's output is not heard directly, but used to alter the carrier oscillator.
